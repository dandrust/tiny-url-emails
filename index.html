            <p>Subject: Cut the budget now. Defund GRPD.</p>
            
            <p>Dear Grand Rapids City Commissioners,</p>

            <p>My name is [NAME] and I am a concerned resident of Grand Rapids. I am asking you to call an emergency council meeting and make an amendment to the proposed budget.  </p>

            <p>The GRPD’s budget is currently 39% of the general fund, and I ask that it is reduced to the charter’s minimum allowance of 32%, freeing up around $9M for public services. This funding must be redistributed based on the input of community groups and leaders so that it provides the most relief to communities of color that have historically been over-policed and disinvested in due to the structural racism and inequity that Grand Rapids is built upon, and that the Grand Rapids Police Department and City are complicit in enforcing. </p>

            <p>Public tensions are rising and public opinion is dwindling in regard to the City’s inappropriate response to the murder of George Floyd and militarized, over-policed response to subsequent protests of police brutality and racism. Reform is not enough - listen to the people and improve public services. </p>

            <p>Cut the budget now.</p>

            <p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>[NAME]</p>

Dear Grand Rapids City Commissioners,

My name is [NAME] and I am a concerned resident of Grand Rapids. I am asking you to call an emergency council meeting and make an amendment to the proposed budget.  

The GRPD’s budget is currently 39% of the general fund, and I ask that it is reduced to the charter’s minimum allowance of 32%, freeing up around $9M for public services. This funding must be redistributed based on the input of community groups and leaders so that it provides the most relief to communities of color that have historically been over-policed and disinvested in due to the structural racism and inequity that Grand Rapids is built upon, and that the Grand Rapids Police Department and City are complicit in enforcing. 

Public tensions are rising and public opinion is dwindling in regard to the City’s inappropriate response to the murder of George Floyd and militarized, over-policed response to subsequent protests of police brutality and racism. Reform is not enough - listen to the people and improve public services. 

Cut the budget now.

Sincerely,

[NAME]
